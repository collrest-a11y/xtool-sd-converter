# Task: Export Pipeline - SVG/PNG/PDF generation with proper formatting

## Description
Implement a robust export pipeline that generates high-quality SVG, PNG, and PDF outputs with proper formatting, metadata, and optimization. The pipeline should handle batch exports, maintain quality settings, and provide progress feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SVG export with proper vector formatting and embedded metadata
- [ ] PNG export with configurable quality and resolution settings using Sharp
- [ ] PDF export with proper page layouts and multi-page support
- [ ] Batch export functionality for multiple images/formats
- [ ] Progress indicators and cancellation support via React components
- [ ] Format-specific optimization (file size vs quality)
- [ ] Metadata preservation (prompts, settings, generation info) in TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Export templates and presets system with TypeScript configuration types

## Technical Details
- Create TypeScript utilities in `src/lib/export/` for format-specific exports
- Use Sharp for high-performance image processing and PNG optimization
- Implement streaming exports with Node.js streams to avoid memory issues
- Add TypeScript interfaces for format-specific options (DPI for PDF, compression for PNG, etc.)
- Create export queue system with priority handling using TypeScript classes
- Integrate with data management layer through typed API endpoints for metadata embedding
- Build React components for export UI with progress indicators and cancellation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: Data Management Layer (for metadata and storage)
- [ ] Task 4: Configuration System (for export presets and settings)
- [ ] Sharp library for image processing and optimization
- [ ] PDF generation library (e.g., jsPDF, PDFKit) with TypeScript definitions
- [ ] Next.js API routes for server-side export processing
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for export configuration and metadata

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all export formats working
- [ ] Tests written covering all export scenarios
- [ ] Export presets and templates documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarking completed
- [ ] Error handling for failed exports implemented
