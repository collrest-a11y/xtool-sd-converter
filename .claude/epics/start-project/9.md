# Task: Polish & Testing - Error handling, UI refinement, documentation

## Description
Final polish phase focused on comprehensive error handling, UI/UX refinement, performance optimization, and complete documentation. Ensure production-ready quality with robust testing coverage and user-friendly experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages using React Error Boundaries
- [ ] Loading states and progress indicators throughout the Next.js application
- [ ] Responsive design tested across different screen sizes with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards) with TypeScript and React
- [ ] Performance optimization and monitoring for Next.js application
- [ ] Complete user documentation and help system with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Developer documentation and API references for TypeScript/Next.js codebase
- [ ] End-to-end testing suite covering all major workflows using Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline with CI/CD integration for TypeScript projects

## Technical Details
- Implement React Error Boundaries in `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` with contextual error recovery
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring system using TypeScript utilities
- Optimize Next.js bundle size and implement code splitting with dynamic imports
- Create interactive help system with React components for tooltips and guided tours
- Build comprehensive test suite with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright for e2e tests
- Add performance monitoring and analytics with Next.js built-in tools and TypeScript
- Implement proper caching strategies using Next.js caching and SWR with TypeScript
- Use TypeScript strict mode and ESLint for code quality enforcement
- Create TypeScript configuration for optimal development experience

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks (001-007) must be completed
- [ ] Jest and React Testing Library setup for TypeScript/Next.js
- [ ] Playwright for end-to-end testing with TypeScript support
- [ ] Documentation platform supporting TypeScript (e.g., TypeDoc, Storybook)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration for Next.js and TypeScript projects
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools compatible with Next.js (e.g., Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configuration for TypeScript/React

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All error scenarios handled gracefully with recovery options
- [ ] UI/UX tested and refined based on usability feedback
- [ ] Complete documentation published and accessible
- [ ] Test coverage above 85% with all critical paths tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed with no critical issues
- [ ] Production deployment checklist completed
- [ ] User acceptance testing conducted and issues resolved
