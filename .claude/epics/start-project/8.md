# Task: Extension Checker - Auto-install missing SD extensions

## Description
Develop an intelligent extension management system that automatically detects missing Stable Diffusion extensions, provides installation recommendations, and can auto-install compatible extensions. Include dependency resolution and compatibility checking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic detection of installed SD extensions via Node.js scripts
- [ ] TypeScript database models for popular/recommended extensions with metadata
- [ ] Compatibility checking against current SD version using TypeScript functions
- [ ] One-click installation for supported extensions through React UI components
- [ ] Dependency resolution and conflict detection with TypeScript algorithms
- [ ] Extension update notifications and management via Next.js API routes
- [ ] Safe installation with rollback capability using Node.js file operations
- [ ] Extension recommendations based on user workflow with TypeScript analytics
- [ ] Batch installation for extension bundles with progress tracking in React

## Technical Details
- Create Node.js utilities in `src/lib/extensions/` for SD extension management
- Build TypeScript interfaces for extension registry with version compatibility matrix
- Implement safe installation process with backup/restore using Node.js fs operations
- Add extension categorization (ControlNet, Loras, Scripts, etc.) as TypeScript enums
- Build conflict detection using dependency graphs with TypeScript classes
- Create installation queue with progress tracking using React state and TypeScript types
- Use Next.js API routes for server-side extension operations
- Implement file system watchers with TypeScript for extension monitoring

## Dependencies
- [ ] Stable Diffusion Web UI API access with TypeScript client
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for extension metadata database or registry
- [ ] Node.js fs module for file system access during extension installation
- [ ] Git integration for extension repositories using TypeScript bindings
- [ ] Next.js API routes for server-side extension management
- [ ] React components for extension management UI with TypeScript props

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Extension detection and listing working correctly
- [ ] Installation process tested with multiple extension types
- [ ] Rollback mechanism verified for failed installations
- [ ] Compatibility checking prevents incompatible installations
- [ ] Tests covering installation, update, and removal scenarios
- [ ] User interface for extension management integrated
