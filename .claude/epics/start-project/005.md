# Task: Export Pipeline - SVG/PNG/PDF generation with proper formatting

## Description
Implement a robust export pipeline that generates high-quality SVG, PNG, and PDF outputs with proper formatting, metadata, and optimization. The pipeline should handle batch exports, maintain quality settings, and provide progress feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SVG export with proper vector formatting and embedded metadata
- [ ] PNG export with configurable quality and resolution settings
- [ ] PDF export with proper page layouts and multi-page support
- [ ] Batch export functionality for multiple images/formats
- [ ] Progress indicators and cancellation support
- [ ] Format-specific optimization (file size vs quality)
- [ ] Metadata preservation (prompts, settings, generation info)
- [ ] Export templates and presets system

## Technical Details
- Utilize canvas-based rendering for consistent output across formats
- Implement streaming exports for large batches to avoid memory issues
- Add format-specific options (DPI for PDF, compression for PNG, etc.)
- Create export queue system with priority handling
- Integrate with the data management layer for metadata embedding

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: Data Management Layer (for metadata and storage)
- [ ] Task 4: Configuration System (for export presets and settings)
- [ ] Canvas API or similar rendering library
- [ ] PDF generation library (e.g., jsPDF, PDFKit)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all export formats working
- [ ] Tests written covering all export scenarios
- [ ] Export presets and templates documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarking completed
- [ ] Error handling for failed exports implemented
