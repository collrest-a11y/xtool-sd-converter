# Task: WebUI Integration

## Description
Establish API connection and test endpoints to integrate with the Stable Diffusion WebUI backend. This involves setting up the communication layer, implementing authentication if needed, and creating utility functions for API interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TypeScript API client class created with connection management
- [ ] Authentication mechanism implemented using fetch API (if required)
- [ ] Test endpoints created for basic operations (txt2img, img2img)
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic implemented
- [ ] API response validation with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Connection health check functionality

## Technical Details
Create a robust TypeScript API client that can handle:
- HTTP requests to WebUI endpoints using fetch API
- Response parsing and error handling with proper TypeScript types
- Connection pooling and timeout management
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Configuration management for API settings using environment variables

## Dependencies
- [ ] Stable Diffusion WebUI running locally or accessible remotely
- [ ] Network connectivity to WebUI instance
- [ ] API documentation or endpoint discovery

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] API endpoints verified working
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
