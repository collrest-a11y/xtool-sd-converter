# Task: xTool Optimizer

## Description
Implement post-processing optimization specifically for xTool laser engravers/cutters. This includes format conversion, power/speed recommendations, and material-specific adjustments to ensure optimal laser compatibility and output quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Support for common xTool file formats (SVG, DXF, etc.)
- [ ] Material-specific optimization profiles
- [ ] Power and speed recommendation engine
- [ ] Layer separation for cut vs engrave operations
- [ ] Path optimization for efficient laser movements
- [ ] Preview of optimized toolpaths
- [ ] Export functionality with xTool-compatible settings

## Technical Details
Create optimization pipeline that:
- Analyzes processed images from Style Engine
- Applies xTool-specific optimizations
- Generates appropriate file formats
- Provides material and operation recommendations
- Optimizes for laser efficiency and quality
- Integrates with xTool software workflow

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 (Style Engine) completed
- [ ] xTool software documentation and specs
- [ ] Material database for optimization profiles
- [ ] File format conversion libraries

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] xTool format export working correctly
- [ ] Material optimization profiles implemented
- [ ] Power/speed recommendations validated
- [ ] Integration with xTool workflow verified
