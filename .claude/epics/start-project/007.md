# Task: Extension Checker - Auto-install missing SD extensions

## Description
Develop an intelligent extension management system that automatically detects missing Stable Diffusion extensions, provides installation recommendations, and can auto-install compatible extensions. Include dependency resolution and compatibility checking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic detection of installed SD extensions
- [ ] Database of popular/recommended extensions with metadata
- [ ] Compatibility checking against current SD version
- [ ] One-click installation for supported extensions
- [ ] Dependency resolution and conflict detection
- [ ] Extension update notifications and management
- [ ] Safe installation with rollback capability
- [ ] Extension recommendations based on user workflow
- [ ] Batch installation for extension bundles

## Technical Details
- Integrate with Stable Diffusion API to query installed extensions
- Create extension registry with version compatibility matrix
- Implement safe installation process with backup/restore
- Add extension categorization (ControlNet, Loras, Scripts, etc.)
- Build conflict detection using dependency graphs
- Create installation queue with progress tracking

## Dependencies
- [ ] Stable Diffusion Web UI API access
- [ ] Extension metadata database or registry
- [ ] File system access for extension installation
- [ ] Git integration for extension repositories

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Extension detection and listing working correctly
- [ ] Installation process tested with multiple extension types
- [ ] Rollback mechanism verified for failed installations
- [ ] Compatibility checking prevents incompatible installations
- [ ] Tests covering installation, update, and removal scenarios
- [ ] User interface for extension management integrated
