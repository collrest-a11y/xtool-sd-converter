# Task: WebUI Integration

## Description
Establish API connection and test endpoints to integrate with the Stable Diffusion WebUI backend. This involves setting up the communication layer, implementing authentication if needed, and creating utility functions for API interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API client module created with connection management
- [ ] Authentication mechanism implemented (if required)
- [ ] Test endpoints created for basic operations (txt2img, img2img)
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic implemented
- [ ] API response validation and typing
- [ ] Connection health check functionality

## Technical Details
Create a robust API client that can handle:
- HTTP requests to WebUI endpoints
- Response parsing and error handling
- Connection pooling and timeout management
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Configuration management for API settings

## Dependencies
- [ ] Stable Diffusion WebUI running locally or accessible remotely
- [ ] Network connectivity to WebUI instance
- [ ] API documentation or endpoint discovery

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] API endpoints verified working
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
