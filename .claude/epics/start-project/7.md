# Task: Prompt System - Advanced prompt builder and template manager

## Description
Create a sophisticated prompt building and template management system that helps users craft effective prompts through intelligent suggestions, templates, and modular prompt components. Include support for negative prompts, style modifiers, and prompt optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive React prompt builder with drag-and-drop components using TypeScript
- [ ] Template library with categorized prompt templates stored as TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Smart prompt suggestions based on context and keywords with React components
- [ ] Negative prompt management and suggestions with TypeScript validation
- [ ] Style modifier system (art styles, photography styles, etc.) as typed enums
- [ ] Prompt validation and optimization recommendations with TypeScript functions
- [ ] Custom template creation and sharing with React forms and TypeScript schemas
- [ ] Prompt history and favorites system with Next.js API routes and TypeScript models
- [ ] Import/export functionality for prompt collections as JSON with TypeScript types

## Technical Details
- Build modular React prompt components in `src/components/prompt/` with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement fuzzy search for template discovery using TypeScript utilities
- Create prompt analysis engine with TypeScript functions for quality scoring
- Add real-time preview of prompt structure using React state and TypeScript types
- Integrate with Next.js UI framework using TypeScript and React components
- Support for advanced prompt syntax (emphasis, wildcards, etc.) with TypeScript parsers
- Use React Context for prompt state management with TypeScript providers
- Create custom React hooks for prompt manipulation with full TypeScript typing

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2: Core UI Framework (for React component integration)
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for prompt templates and structured data models
- [ ] Text processing libraries with TypeScript definitions for prompt analysis
- [ ] React DnD library for drag-and-drop functionality with TypeScript support
- [ ] Zustand or React Context for state management with TypeScript
- [ ] Next.js API routes for prompt template CRUD operations

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Prompt builder interface implemented and functional
- [ ] Template system with CRUD operations working
- [ ] Prompt optimization engine providing useful suggestions
- [ ] Template library populated with quality examples
- [ ] Tests covering all prompt manipulation scenarios
- [ ] User documentation for advanced prompt techniques
