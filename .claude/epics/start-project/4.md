# Task: Style Engine

## Description
Implement 5 primary conversion styles with optimized prompts for laser engraving/cutting applications. Each style should transform input images into formats suitable for laser processing with distinct aesthetic approaches.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Line Art style - clean vector-like outlines
- [ ] Halftone style - dot pattern for grayscale representation
- [ ] Stipple style - stippled/pointillism effect
- [ ] Geometric style - geometric pattern interpretation
- [ ] Minimalist style - simplified high-contrast output
- [ ] Style selection UI component
- [ ] Real-time preview of style application
- [ ] Style-specific parameter controls

## Technical Details
Create a TypeScript style processing engine that:
- Applies different image processing techniques per style using TypeScript classes
- Generates appropriate Stable Diffusion prompts with type-safe templates
- Manages style-specific parameters and settings through TypeScript interfaces
- Provides consistent output formatting with proper typing
- Optimizes results for laser compatibility using .ts utility functions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (WebUI Integration) completed
- [ ] Image processing libraries identified (TypeScript-compatible)
- [ ] Style reference examples collected

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] All 5 styles implemented and working
- [ ] Style parameters properly configurable
- [ ] Output quality verified for laser applications
