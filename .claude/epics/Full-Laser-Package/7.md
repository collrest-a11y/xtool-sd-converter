# Task: Production Deployment

## Description

Implement production-ready deployment infrastructure including monitoring and observability, structured logging, automated backup systems, comprehensive documentation, and production hardening. Ensure the application is ready for production use with proper operational procedures and disaster recovery capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Production Docker deployment with health checks and auto-restart
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system operational
- [ ] Structured logging with centralized log aggregation
- [ ] Automated backup system for databases and user data
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration with certificate auto-renewal
- [ ] Production environment configuration management
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Performance monitoring and capacity planning tools
- [ ] User documentation and admin guides completed
- [ ] Production deployment runbook and troubleshooting guides

## Technical Details

**Deployment Infrastructure:**
- Docker Compose production configuration
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Auto-restart policies and resource limits
- Load balancer configuration (if applicable)
- Database migration and rollback procedures

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) setup
- Custom metrics collection and dashboards
- Uptime monitoring with external health checks
- Error tracking and alerting configuration
- Performance metrics and SLA monitoring
- Capacity planning and resource utilization tracking

**Logging Infrastructure:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Centralized log aggregation (ELK stack or similar)
- Log retention policies and archival
- Search and analysis capabilities
- Security event logging and monitoring
- Performance and audit trail logging

**Backup & Recovery:**
- Automated database backup with point-in-time recovery
- User-uploaded file backup and versioning
- Configuration backup and version control
- Backup verification and restore testing
- Disaster recovery procedures and documentation
- Data retention and compliance policies

**Security Hardening:**
- SSL/TLS configuration with security headers
- Certificate management and auto-renewal
- Network security and firewall configuration
- Access control and privilege management
- Security scanning and vulnerability monitoring
- Compliance and audit trail maintenance

**Documentation:**
- User manual and feature documentation
- Administrator deployment and maintenance guide
- API documentation with examples
- Troubleshooting and FAQ documentation
- Architecture and design documentation
- Operational runbooks and procedures

**Code Locations:**
- `/deployment/` - Production deployment configurations
- `/monitoring/` - Monitoring and alerting setup
- `/docs/` - User and administrator documentation
- `/scripts/` - Deployment and maintenance scripts
- `/backup/` - Backup and recovery automation
- `/.env.production` - Production environment configuration

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 9 (Performance Optimization) - Required for production performance monitoring
- [ ] Task 2 (Security & Validation) - Required for production security hardening
- [ ] Task 4 (Testing & Quality) - Required for validated production deployment
- [ ] Production hosting environment and infrastructure
- [ ] SSL certificate procurement and configuration
- [ ] Monitoring service setup and configuration

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 40-56 hours
- Parallel: false (final production hardening step)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with production-ready configuration
- [ ] All monitoring and alerting operational and tested
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures validated through testing
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration secure and automated
- [ ] Production deployment successful with zero downtime
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible to end users
- [ ] Performance monitoring showing acceptable metrics
- [ ] Security audit passed with no high-severity issues
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan tested and documented
- [ ] Operations team trained on maintenance procedures
- [ ] Production environment stable and monitored 24/7
