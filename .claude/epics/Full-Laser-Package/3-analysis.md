# Issue #3 Analysis: AI Integration

## Parallel Work Streams

This AI integration system can be broken into 3 parallel streams:

### Stream A: AI Model & Infrastructure (Backend)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: Stable Diffusion integration and model management
**Files**: `backend/app/services/ai/`, model management, GPU processing
**Work**:
- Stable Diffusion local model setup with CUDA support
- Model management system (download, update, versioning)
- GPU memory management and batch processing
- Cloud AI API integration (Replicate, OpenAI DALL-E)
- AI processing queue with Celery
- Resource management and optimization
- Model performance monitoring

### Stream B: AI Processing Pipeline & Optimization
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: Image generation pipeline and post-processing
**Files**: `backend/app/services/ai_processor.py`, optimization algorithms
**Work**:
- Intelligent prompt engineering for laser cutting
- AI image post-processing for laser optimization
- Batch generation and queuing system
- Image quality enhancement for engraving
- Style transfer and artistic processing
- Prompt suggestion and optimization
- Generation history and management

### Stream C: AI Interface & User Experience (Frontend)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: AI generation UI and user workflow
**Files**: `frontend/src/components/AIGenerator/`, React components
**Work**:
- AI image generation interface with prompt input
- Real-time generation progress tracking
- AI model selection and settings controls
- Prompt suggestion and templates
- Generated image gallery and management
- AI image to laser workflow integration
- Batch generation management UI

## Dependencies Between Streams
- Stream A provides the AI infrastructure for B & C
- Stream B creates the processing pipeline that C controls
- Stream C provides the user interface for A & B capabilities
- All streams coordinate on generation parameters and workflows

## Coordination Points
1. AI model configuration and capabilities (all streams)
2. Generation request/response schemas (A & C)
3. Processing pipeline parameters (B & C)
4. Resource management and queuing (A & B)

## Success Criteria
- Seamless AI image generation integrated into laser workflow
- Optimized AI outputs for laser cutting applications
- Efficient resource usage and batch processing
- Professional AI generation interface with advanced controls
