# Issue #2 Analysis: Security & Validation

## Parallel Work Streams

This comprehensive security implementation can be broken into 3 parallel streams:

### Stream A: Backend Security Infrastructure
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: Server-side security measures and validation
**Files**: `backend/app/core/security.py`, middleware, auth systems
**Work**:
- File upload security with virus scanning (ClamAV integration)
- Input sanitization and validation middleware
- Rate limiting implementation with Redis
- CSRF protection and secure headers
- Authentication system hardening (JWT, sessions)
- SQL injection and XSS protection
- Security audit logging infrastructure

### Stream B: Frontend Security & Validation
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: Client-side security and input validation
**Files**: `frontend/src/lib/security/`, React components
**Work**:
- Client-side input validation with Zod
- Secure file upload components with type checking
- CSRF token handling in API calls
- XSS prevention in user content display
- Secure form handling and sanitization
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Client-side rate limiting feedback

### Stream C: Security Monitoring & Audit
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: Security monitoring and compliance
**Files**: Security monitoring services, audit systems
**Work**:
- Security event logging and tracking
- Dependency vulnerability scanning setup
- Security audit infrastructure
- Intrusion detection and alerting
- Compliance reporting and metrics
- Security testing automation
- Penetration testing preparation

## Dependencies Between Streams
- Stream A provides the core security foundation for B & C
- Stream B implements client-side protections that work with A
- Stream C monitors and validates security measures from A & B
- All streams coordinate on security policies and standards

## Coordination Points
1. Security policy definitions (all streams)
2. API authentication contracts (A & B)
3. Audit event schemas (A & C)
4. Rate limiting thresholds and feedback (A & B)

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive security posture across all attack vectors
- Production-ready authentication and authorization
- Complete audit trail and monitoring
- Vulnerability scanning and automated security testing
