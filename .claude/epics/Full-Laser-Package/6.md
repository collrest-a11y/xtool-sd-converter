# Task: Advanced Box Features

## Overview

Extend the core box designer with sophisticated mechanical features including hinges, dividers, living hinges, and complex geometries. This enhancement transforms the basic box generator into a comprehensive parametric design system capable of creating professional-grade laser-cut assemblies with advanced joinery and functional elements.

## Background

While basic box generation covers simple rectangular enclosures, real-world laser cutting projects often require sophisticated mechanical features. Hinges enable moving parts, dividers create organization systems, living hinges provide flexible connections, and complex geometries allow for artistic and functional design variations. These features require precise mathematical calculations and validated joint mechanics.

## Technical Scope

### Hinge Systems
- **Piano Hinges**: Continuous hinges for full-width openings with precise pin hole alignment
- **Butt Hinges**: Traditional hinges with leaf calculations and mounting hole patterns
- **Living Hinges**: Flexible connections using material properties and stress analysis
- **Invisible Hinges**: Internal hinge mechanisms with concealed mounting systems

### Divider and Organization Systems
- **Grid Dividers**: Configurable grid systems with adjustable cell sizes and interlocking joints
- **Custom Compartments**: User-defined compartment layouts with automatic wall generation
- **Removable Inserts**: Modular organization systems with press-fit and sliding mechanisms
- **Angled Dividers**: Non-orthogonal divisions for specialized storage and display applications

### Living Hinge Engineering
- **Flex Pattern Library**: Multiple living hinge patterns (straight cuts, curved patterns, honeycomb, parametric waves)
- **Stress Analysis**: Material stress calculations preventing hinge failure and optimizing flexibility
- **Kerf Pattern Optimization**: Cut width and spacing calculations for different materials and thicknesses
- **Bend Radius Control**: Precise control over achievable bend angles and spring-back characteristics

### Complex Geometry Support
- **Curved Surfaces**: Parametric curve generation with developable surface calculations
- **Organic Shapes**: Bezier curve integration and organic form generation with laser-cut compatibility
- **Interlocking Assemblies**: Complex multi-part assemblies with automatic part generation and assembly guides
- **Artistic Elements**: Decorative patterns, filigree, and artistic cutouts integrated with structural design
