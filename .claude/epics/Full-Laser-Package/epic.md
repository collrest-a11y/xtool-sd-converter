# Epic: Full-Laser-Package

## Overview

The Full-Laser-Package epic delivers a production-ready web application combining parametric box generation, advanced image processing, and laser engraving calculations. The system leverages Next.js frontend with TypeScript, Python backend APIs, and comprehensive Playwright testing to create an end-to-end solution for laser cutting workflows.

## Architecture Decisions

**Frontend Architecture:**
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript for type safety and performance
- App Router for modern routing and layouts
- React Server Components for optimal performance
- Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive design
- Zustand for client-side state management

**Backend Architecture:**
- FastAPI Python framework for high-performance APIs
- Pydantic for request/response validation and serialization
- SQLite for local data persistence (material database, settings)
- Redis for session management and caching
- Celery for background image processing tasks

**Image Processing Pipeline:**
- OpenCV and PIL/Pillow for core image manipulation
- Custom algorithms for trace conversion and style transformations
- Background removal using advanced segmentation models
- SVG generation using svglib and custom path optimization

**Integration Strategy:**
- Stable Diffusion integration via local inference or API
- RESTful API design with OpenAPI documentation
- File upload handling with security scanning
- Real-time parameter updates via WebSocket connections

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core UI Components:**
- BoxDesigner: Parametric box configuration with real-time preview
- ImageProcessor: Multi-step image transformation workflow
- CalculatorWidget: Laser engraving depth and settings calculator
- FileManager: Upload, preview, and export functionality
- 3DPreview: Three.js integration for box visualization

**State Management:**
- Global app state via Zustand stores
- Real-time parameter synchronization
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
- Form validation with Zod schemas

**User Interaction Patterns:**
- Drag-and-drop file uploads with progress indicators
- Real-time parameter sliders with debounced API calls
- Multi-step workflows with progress tracking
- Download queue management with batch operations

### Backend Services

**API Endpoints:**
- `/api/boxes/` - Box generation and template management
- `/api/images/` - Image upload, processing, and transformation
- `/api/materials/` - Material database and laser calculations
- `/api/export/` - SVG generation and download management
- `/api/ai/` - Stable Diffusion integration endpoints

**Data Models:**
- BoxTemplate: Parametric definitions for box types
- MaterialProfile: Laser cutting parameters by material type
- ProcessingJob: Image transformation task tracking
- ExportRequest: SVG generation and download tracking

**Business Logic:**
- Parametric box generation algorithms
- Joint calculation and material compensation
- Image processing pipeline orchestration
- Laser parameter optimization engines

### Infrastructure

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Docker containers for consistent deployment
- Local development with hot reload
- Production deployment via Docker Compose
- Environment-based configuration management

**Monitoring and Observability:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting
- Health check endpoints

**Security Measures:**
- File upload validation and virus scanning
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure file handling with automatic cleanup

## Implementation Strategy

**Development Phases:**
1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**: Project setup, core APIs, basic UI
2. **Box Generation (Weeks 5-8)**: Parametric designer, templates, SVG export
3. **Image Processing (Weeks 9-12)**: Upload, transformation, AI integration
4. **Integration (Weeks 13-16)**: Calculator, optimization, production hardening

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive Playwright testing for all user workflows
- Incremental deployment with feature flags
- Performance benchmarking at each milestone
- Security audit before production deployment

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for all business logic components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end Playwright tests for complete user journeys
- Performance testing for image processing pipelines
- Security testing for file upload functionality
