## Technical Details

### Processing Pipeline Architecture
```python
class ImageProcessor:
    def __init__(self, image_path, settings):
        self.image = load_image(image_path)
        self.settings = settings
        self.pipeline = []

    def add_transformation(self, transform_type, params):
        # Add transformation to pipeline

    def process(self):
        # Execute pipeline with progress callbacks

    def preview(self, transform_index=None):
        # Generate preview at specific pipeline stage
```

### Transformation Examples
```python
# Edge detection
def canny_edge_detection(image, low_threshold=50, high_threshold=150):
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    edges = cv2.Canny(gray, low_threshold, high_threshold)
    return edges

# Halftone conversion
def floyd_steinberg_dither(image, levels=2):
    # Implement Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm

# Line art conversion
def photo_to_line_art(image, line_thickness=1, detail_level=0.5):
    # Convert photo to line drawing using edge detection and morphology
```

### File Storage Strategy
- Temporary storage for uploaded files
- Processed image caching with TTL
- Efficient cleanup of temporary files
- S3-compatible storage integration

### Performance Optimization
- Image pyramid generation for multi-resolution processing
- Chunked processing for very large images
- CPU and memory usage monitoring
- Intelligent caching strategies

## Dependencies
- **Requires**: Task 5 (Project Foundation Setup) must be completed
- **Can run parallel with**: Task 8 (Core Box Designer)
- **Provides**: Image processing capabilities for engraving features

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Large image files causing memory issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement streaming processing, set file size limits, monitor memory usage
- **Risk**: Slow processing times affecting user experience
  - **Mitigation**: Use background processing, provide progress indicators, optimize algorithms
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in image uploads
  - **Mitigation**: Implement virus scanning, validate file types, sanitize metadata

## Success Metrics
- Process typical images (< 5MB) in under 10 seconds
- Support images up to 50MB without system instability
- 95% user satisfaction with transformation quality
- Zero security incidents related to file uploads
- API response times < 200ms for non-processing endpoints

## Notes
This image processing engine will be crucial for users who want to engrave photos or artwork. Focus on creating high-quality transformations that work well with laser engraving constraints. The system should be extensible to add new transformation algorithms as user needs evolve.
