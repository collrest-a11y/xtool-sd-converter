# Task: AI Integration

## Overview

Integrate Stable Diffusion AI image generation capabilities into the laser engraving workflow, enabling users to generate custom images, modify existing designs, and create variations optimized for laser cutting. This integration will provide both local and cloud-based AI processing options with intelligent prompt engineering and batch processing capabilities.

## Background

AI-generated imagery has become essential for custom laser engraving projects, allowing users to create unique designs without requiring artistic skills. However, raw AI outputs often need optimization for laser cutting - proper contrast, simplified details, and appropriate sizing. This integration will provide a seamless AI-to-laser workflow with specialized post-processing.

## Technical Scope

### AI Model Integration
- **Stable Diffusion Setup**: Local model deployment with CUDA support for GPU acceleration and CPU fallback options
- **Model Management**: Download, update, and version management for multiple SD models (base, artistic, photorealistic)
- **Cloud Integration**: Optional integration with external AI APIs (Replicate, OpenAI DALL-E) for enhanced capabilities
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent memory management and batch processing for multiple generations

### Prompt Engineering System
- **Laser-Optimized Prompts**: Predefined prompt templates optimized for laser engraving (high contrast, simple details, clear lines)
- **Style Transfer**: Prompt modification system for converting complex images to laser-friendly styles
- **Negative Prompts**: Automated negative prompt injection to avoid problematic elements (gradients, fine details, complex backgrounds)
- **Prompt History**: Save, modify, and replay successful prompts with parameter tracking

### Batch Processing Pipeline
- **Queue Management**: Asynchronous job processing with progress tracking and error handling
- **Variation Generation**: Create multiple variations from single prompts with parameter sweeps
- **Auto-Optimization**: Automatic post-processing pipeline applying laser-friendly filters and adjustments
- **Result Curation**: AI-assisted ranking and selection of best results based on laser cutting criteria

### Output Optimization
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Automatic contrast adjustment and histogram optimization for clear cutting lines
- **Detail Simplification**: Edge detection and simplification algorithms to remove laser-incompatible fine details
- **Size Optimization**: Intelligent scaling and cropping for optimal laser bed utilization
- **Format Conversion**: Seamless conversion to SVG with proper vectorization for cutting paths
