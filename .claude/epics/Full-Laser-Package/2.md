# Task: Security & Validation

## Description

Implement comprehensive security measures and input validation across the application including file upload security, input sanitization, rate limiting, authentication/authorization, and security audit infrastructure. Ensure production-ready security posture for all user-facing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File upload security with virus scanning and type validation
- [ ] Input sanitization and validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting on all API endpoints with configurable thresholds
- [ ] CSRF protection and secure headers implementation
- [ ] Authentication system with secure session management
- [ ] Authorization controls for sensitive operations
- [ ] Security audit logging with structured event tracking
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning and monitoring
- [ ] Secure file handling with automatic cleanup
- [ ] SQL injection and XSS protection measures

## Technical Details

**File Upload Security:**
- File type validation with whitelist approach
- File size limits and quota management
- Virus scanning integration (ClamAV or similar)
- Secure file storage with access controls
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Metadata stripping from uploaded images

**Input Validation:**
- Pydantic models for API request validation
- Frontend form validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection with content sanitization
- File path traversal prevention
- Command injection protection for external tools

**Rate Limiting:**
- API endpoint rate limiting with Redis backend
- Progressive penalties for repeated violations
- IP-based and user-based rate limiting
- Configurable thresholds by endpoint type
- Rate limit headers in API responses

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Secure session management with HttpOnly cookies
- Password hashing with bcrypt or Argon2
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session timeout and renewal
- Secure logout with session invalidation

**Security Monitoring:**
- Structured security event logging
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Suspicious activity detection and alerting
- Security metrics collection and reporting
- Compliance logging for audit trails

**Code Locations:**
- `/backend/security/` - Security middleware and utilities
- `/backend/validation/` - Input validation schemas
- `/backend/auth/` - Authentication and authorization
- `/backend/middleware/` - Rate limiting and security headers
- `/frontend/validation/` - Client-side validation schemas
- `/security/` - Security configuration and monitoring

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 5 (Project Foundation) - Required for security infrastructure setup
- [ ] Task 10 (Image Processing Engine) - Required for file upload security
- [ ] Redis server for rate limiting and session storage
- [ ] Security scanning tools and dependencies
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate configuration

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 40-56 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other infrastructure tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive security measures
- [ ] All security features tested with penetration testing
- [ ] Rate limiting operational and tested under load
- [ ] Authentication system secure and user-friendly
- [ ] Security audit logging functional with proper retention
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Tests written and passing for all security features
- [ ] Security documentation and guidelines created
- [ ] Code reviewed with security focus
- [ ] Security audit completed with remediation
- [ ] Deployed to staging with security monitoring active
