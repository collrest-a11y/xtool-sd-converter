# Task: Performance Optimization

## Description

Implement comprehensive performance optimization across the entire application stack including caching layers, background processing for long-running operations, real-time updates via WebSocket connections, and performance monitoring infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Redis caching layer implemented for frequently accessed data (box templates, material profiles)
- [ ] Background processing queue with Celery for image processing operations
- [ ] WebSocket connections for real-time parameter updates in box designer
- [ ] Performance monitoring with metrics collection and alerting
- [ ] Database query optimization with indexing strategy
- [ ] Frontend bundle optimization and lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Image processing pipeline optimization with progressive loading
- [ ] API response time improvements with sub-second response targets
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for large image processing tasks
- [ ] CDN setup for static asset delivery

## Technical Details

**Caching Strategy:**
- Redis implementation for session management and frequently accessed data
- Browser caching headers for static assets and API responses
- Application-level caching for expensive calculations (box joints, material properties)
- Cache invalidation strategy for data consistency

**Background Processing:**
- Celery worker setup for image processing tasks
- Queue management with priority levels for different operation types
- Progress tracking and status updates for long-running operations
- Error handling and retry logic for failed background tasks

**Real-time Features:**
- WebSocket server implementation for parameter synchronization
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
- Real-time preview updates for box designer
- Live progress indicators for image processing operations

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Application performance monitoring (APM) integration
- Custom metrics collection for key user workflows
- Performance benchmarking suite for regression testing
- Alert configuration for performance degradation

**Code Locations:**
- `/backend/cache/` - Redis caching implementation
- `/backend/workers/` - Celery background task definitions
- `/backend/websocket/` - WebSocket server and handlers
- `/frontend/hooks/` - Real-time data synchronization hooks
- `/monitoring/` - Performance monitoring configuration

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 8 (Core Box Designer) - Required for box parameter caching
- [ ] Task 10 (Image Processing Engine) - Required for background processing optimization
- [ ] Task 11 (Laser Calculator) - Required for material profile caching
- [ ] Redis server setup and configuration
- [ ] Celery worker infrastructure
- [ ] WebSocket server dependencies

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 48-64 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other optimization tasks once core features exist)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive caching strategy
- [ ] Background processing queue operational with monitoring
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet target metrics
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Tests written and passing for all performance features
- [ ] Documentation updated with performance guidelines
- [ ] Code reviewed and performance validated
- [ ] Load testing completed with acceptable results
- [ ] Deployed to staging with performance monitoring active
