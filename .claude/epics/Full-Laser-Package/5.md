## Overview
Establish the complete technical foundation for the laser engraving suite, including modern web frontend, Python backend services, containerized deployment, and automated CI/CD pipeline. This foundational infrastructure will support all subsequent development phases.

## Objectives
- Set up scalable, production-ready web application architecture
- Establish robust backend services with proper API design
- Implement containerized deployment for consistency across environments
- Create automated testing and deployment pipeline
- Ensure proper security, monitoring, and documentation standards

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Next.js Frontend Framework**: Modern React-based web application with TypeScript

- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Authentication System**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control

### Technical Requirements
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local development, Kubernetes-ready
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Black, mypy integration
- **Testing Framework**: Jest for frontend, pytest for backend with coverage reporting
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics collection, structured logging
- **Environment Management**: Proper secrets management and environment configuration

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Development Environment**: Consistent local setup with hot reload
- **Staging Environment**: Production-like environment for testing
- **Production Deployment**: Scalable, secure deployment configuration
- **Database Migrations**: Automated schema management with rollback capability
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated backups for databases and user data

### Database Schema (Initial)
- Users table with authentication data
- Projects table for user workspaces
- Files table for upload tracking
- Audit logs for security and compliance

### API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- Consistent error response format
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Field selection and filtering capabilities
- Rate limiting per user/IP
- API versioning in URL path

## Dependencies
This is the foundational task with no dependencies. All subsequent tasks depend on this completion.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complex initial setup may delay other tasks
  - **Mitigation**: Use proven tools and frameworks, follow established patterns
- **Risk**: Over-engineering the foundation
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on essential features first, iterate based on actual needs
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in initial setup
  - **Mitigation**: Follow security best practices, implement automated security scanning

## Success Metrics
- All developers can set up local environment in <30 minutes
- CI/CD pipeline runs in <10 minutes for typical changes
- 100% test coverage for critical authentication and security components
- Zero security vulnerabilities in initial security scan
- Documentation completeness score >90%

## Notes
This foundation will be the cornerstone for all subsequent development. Focus on creating a robust, scalable base that can support rapid feature development while maintaining code quality and security standards.
