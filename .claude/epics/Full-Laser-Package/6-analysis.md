# Issue #6 Analysis: Advanced Box Features

## Parallel Work Streams

This advanced box features system can be broken into 3 parallel streams:

### Stream A: Mechanical Engineering Systems (Backend)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: Advanced joinery algorithms and mechanical calculations
**Files**: `backend/app/services/advanced_box.py`, mechanical algorithms
**Work**:
- Hinge system calculations (piano, butt, living hinges)
- Divider and organization system algorithms
- Living hinge stress analysis and flex patterns
- Complex geometry support (curves, organic shapes)
- Advanced joint calculations (dovetail, mortise)
- Mechanical constraint validation
- Stress testing and failure analysis

### Stream B: Advanced Designer UI (Frontend)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: Advanced design interface and controls
**Files**: `frontend/src/components/AdvancedBoxDesigner/`, React components
**Work**:
- Advanced hinge configuration interface
- Divider design system with grid layouts
- Living hinge parameter controls
- Complex geometry design tools
- Advanced joint selection and configuration
- Multi-panel assembly interface
- Advanced preview and validation

### Stream C: Assembly & Manufacturing Output
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Focus**: Assembly instructions and manufacturing optimization
**Files**: Assembly generation, manufacturing optimization
**Work**:
- Assembly instruction generation
- Manufacturing sequence optimization
- Multi-stage cutting and assembly workflow
- Quality control and testing procedures
- Advanced SVG export with assembly marks
- Manufacturing time and cost estimation
- Production planning and scheduling

## Dependencies Between Streams
- Stream A provides the mechanical engineering foundation for B & C
- Stream B creates the user interface that controls Stream A
- Stream C generates the manufacturing output from A calculations
- All streams coordinate on mechanical constraints and capabilities

## Coordination Points
1. Mechanical engineering specifications (all streams)
2. Advanced parameter schemas (A & B)
3. Assembly instruction formats (A & C)
4. Manufacturing optimization algorithms (A & C)

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive advanced box features with professional-grade mechanics
- Intuitive interface for complex mechanical design
- Complete assembly instructions and manufacturing optimization
- Validated mechanical designs with stress analysis
