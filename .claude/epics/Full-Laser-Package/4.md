# Task: Testing & Quality

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure including end-to-end Playwright test suites, performance benchmarking, code coverage analysis, and quality assurance automation. Ensure all implemented features are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards before production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Playwright end-to-end test suites covering all user workflows
- [ ] Unit test coverage minimum 90% for critical business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for all API endpoints and services
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite with automated regression detection
- [ ] Visual regression testing for UI components
- [ ] Load testing scenarios for image processing and concurrent users
- [ ] Test data management and cleanup automation
- [ ] Continuous integration pipeline with quality gates
- [ ] Code quality analysis with linting and static analysis
- [ ] Test reporting and metrics dashboard

## Technical Details

**End-to-End Testing:**
- Playwright test suites for complete user journeys
- Box design workflow testing from parameter input to SVG export
- Image processing pipeline testing with various file types
- Calculator functionality testing with different materials
- AI integration testing with mock and real services
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing

**Unit Testing:**
- Jest/Vitest for frontend component testing
- pytest for Python backend testing
- Mock services and external dependencies
- Test fixtures and factories for data generation
- Parameterized tests for edge cases
- Error condition testing and recovery

**Performance Testing:**
- Load testing with k6 or Artillery
- Image processing performance benchmarks
- API response time validation
- Memory usage profiling and leak detection
- Database query performance testing
- Frontend bundle size and load time analysis

**Quality Assurance:**
- ESLint, Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Black, flake8, mypy for Python code
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency audit and license compliance
- Code coverage reporting with coverage thresholds

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Test database setup and teardown automation
- Test file and asset management
- Parallel test execution optimization
- Test result aggregation and reporting
- CI/CD integration with quality gates
- Flaky test detection and resolution

**Code Locations:**
- `/tests/e2e/` - Playwright end-to-end tests
- `/tests/unit/` - Unit tests for all components
- `/tests/integration/` - API and service integration tests
- `/tests/performance/` - Load and performance testing
- `/tests/fixtures/` - Test data and utilities
- `/.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 8 (Core Box Designer) - Required for box design workflow testing
- [ ] Task 10 (Image Processing Engine) - Required for image processing testing
- [ ] Task 11 (Laser Calculator) - Required for calculator functionality testing
- [ ] Task 3 (AI Integration) - Required for AI workflow testing
- [ ] Task 6 (Advanced Box Features) - Required for complex feature testing
- [ ] Testing infrastructure and browser automation setup
- [ ] Performance testing tools and monitoring

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 56-72 hours
- Parallel: false (must test all implemented features sequentially)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] All Playwright test suites passing and stable
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and validated
- [ ] Quality gates integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test documentation and guidelines created
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- [ ] Load testing scenarios validated under realistic conditions
- [ ] Visual regression testing operational
- [ ] Security testing completed with no high-severity issues
- [ ] Test reporting dashboard functional and accessible
- [ ] All tests green in staging environment
