## üéØ Architecture Highlights

### Progressive Disclosure Implementation
```typescript
// Clean interface that only shows advanced features when requested
const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);

// Tabbed organization for different feature categories
const tabItems = [
  { id: 'hinges', label: 'Hinges', icon: Settings },
  { id: 'dividers', label: 'Dividers', icon: Layers },
  { id: 'living-hinges', label: 'Living Hinges', icon: Zap },
  { id: 'geometry', label: 'Complex Geometry', icon: Shapes },
  { id: 'assembly', label: 'Multi-Panel Assembly', icon: Puzzle },
];
```

### Real-Time Validation System
```typescript
// Continuous validation with user-friendly feedback
const validateHinge = (hinge: HingeConfiguration): string[] => {
  const warnings: string[] = [];

  if (hinge.length > Math.max(boxDimensions.width, boxDimensions.height)) {
    warnings.push('Hinge length exceeds maximum box dimension');
  }

  if (hinge.type === 'piano' && hinge.pinHoleDiameter && hinge.pinHoleDiameter < 1.0) {
    warnings.push('Pin hole diameter may be too small for reliable operation');
  }

  return warnings;
};
```

### Engineering Calculations
```typescript
// Stress analysis for living hinges
const calculateStressAnalysis = (config: LivingHingeConfig, material: BoxMaterial) => {
  const yieldStrength = getYieldStrength(material.type);
  const maxStress = (material.thickness * 200) / (2 * config.bendRadius);
  const safetyFactor = yieldStrength / maxStress;
  const fatigueRating = Math.floor(100000 * Math.pow(1 - (maxStress / yieldStrength), 3));

  return { maxStress, safetyFactor, fatigueRating };
};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

### Advanced Joint Interface - Not Implemented
The advanced joint selection interface was marked as pending in the original scope. The basic joint controls remain functional in the base BoxDesigner, but the advanced joint configuration (dovetail, mortise, tenon) was not implemented in this phase.

**Recommendation**: This should be addressed in a follow-up task as it would integrate well with the existing hinge and assembly systems.

### Backend Coordination Required
The frontend components are designed to work with the mechanical engineering APIs specified in the requirements. Coordination with the backend stream will be needed to:
- Validate stress calculations on the server side
- Implement SVG export with advanced features
- Provide material property databases
- Generate assembly instructions

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-up Tasks
1. **Backend Integration**: Connect advanced features to mechanical calculation APIs
2. **Advanced Joint Interface**: Implement remaining joint configuration UI
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all advanced features
4. **Documentation**: User guides for professional features

### Future Enhancements
1. **3D Preview Implementation**: Replace placeholder with actual 3D visualization
2. **Export Optimization**: Advanced SVG export with feature layers
3. **Template System**: Advanced template creation and sharing
4. **Collaboration**: Multi-user design collaboration features
