# PRD: Full-Laser-Package

## Executive Summary

The Full-Laser-Package is a comprehensive web-based application that provides an end-to-end solution for laser cutting box designs. It combines parametric box generation with advanced image processing capabilities and laser engraving calculations. The system enables rapid creation of custom boxes with various templates, materials support, and artistic engraving features while providing precise cutting instructions and depth calculations.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Manual box design for laser cutting is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires specialized CAD knowledge. Users struggle with:
- Creating accurate parametric box designs with proper joint calculations
- Converting images to laser-suitable formats (line art, silhouettes, papercut designs)
- Calculating precise laser settings for different materials and desired engraving depths
- Generating properly formatted SVG files for laser cutters

**Why is this important now?**
As personal laser cutters become more accessible, there's a growing need for user-friendly tools that bridge the gap between creative ideas and manufacturable designs. The combination of box generation and artistic processing in one platform eliminates workflow friction.

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Solo Maker/Creator
- Personal laser cutter owner
- Creates custom boxes for personal projects, gifts, prototypes
- Limited CAD experience but strong creative vision
- Values efficiency and precision

### User Journeys

**Box Design Journey:**
1. User accesses web interface
2. Selects box template (simple rectangular, custom shape, or feature-enhanced)
3. Inputs dimensions, material thickness, joint type
4. Previews 3D visualization
5. Downloads SVG file optimized for laser cutting

**Image Processing Journey:**
1. User uploads photo/artwork
2. Selects processing type (trace, silhouette, papercut, line art, sketch)
3. Adjusts parameters and preview results
4. Optionally uses AI prompts for Stable Diffusion enhancement
5. Downloads processed image as SVG for engraving

**Engraving Calculation Journey:**
1. User selects material type and thickness
2. Inputs desired engraving depth
3. System calculates optimal laser passes, power, and speed settings
4. User exports settings for laser cutter
